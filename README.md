# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
The Disaster Reporting Network tasked us with creating an interactive map that displays earthquakes around the world. The map shows the relationship between earthquakes and tectonic plates. This map has three overlays of earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates. In addition to the overlays, the user can view the map with three different tile layers. The location of each earthquake is shown through circular markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color. Also, there is a pop-up marker that will allow the user to identify the actual magnitude and location of the given earthquake.
